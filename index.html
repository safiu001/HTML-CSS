            <h2>Motor rentals</h2>
            <hr>
            <p>With many rental companies, you must be at least 21 years of age to rent a car, and any driver under 25 may have to pay
            a Young Driver Fee. Similarly, people aged 70+ may find some companies will charge a Senior Driver Fee, or may not rent
            to them at all. So car rental for the under-25 or over-70 can be more expensive which is one more reason to book with
            motors.com as we work with all the big brands. Just check each car terms and conditions to see if your age would make
            any difference.Before you buy any car rental insurance, you should find out what coverage is provided by your credit
            card company, your homeowner renter policy, and your own car insurance.</p>
